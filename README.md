### 🚀 Features

1. **Visual Learning:** Stop guessing what happens inside the loop. Our visualizer isolates and highlights the algorithm's exact decisions as they occur.
2. **Playback Control:** Don't just watch — control the flow. Pause, resume, and step through animations at your own pace to truly understand the algorithm's behavior.
3. **Custom Inputs:** Move beyond static examples. Draw custom directed or undirected graphs, edit weights, create binary trees, or input your own numbers to sort.
4. **Share Insights:** Created a tricky graph or a specific tree structure? Generate a unique URL to share your exact visualization setup with peers or students instantly.

### 📚 Algorithms Covered

1. Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Heap Sort, Merge Sort etc.
3. Graph Algorithms: DFS, BFS, Prim's Algorithm etc.
3. Data Structures: Linked List, Binary Heap, AVL Tree etc.
4. Convex Hull, Huffman Coding and more!
